    <h2>Difference between window object & document Object</h2>

    <h3>Window Object:</h3>
    <p>Think of a window as a browser window or an entire tab.
        The Window object represents the global window or tab in which your web application is running.
        It has the same features and options as browsers, such as opening new tabs or changing window sizes.

        <h3>Document Object</h3>
        <p>The document object represents the content of the web page embedded in the window.
            This page contains all HTML elements.
            You can use the document object to upload, and make changes to, the content of your HTML document, such as changing the text or changing the page layout.
            Simply put, a window is like the browser in general, while a document is specific to the content and layout of your web page in that context.</p>
